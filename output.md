to exercise their Executive power.
ii, Exercise of Executive power of people is part of the people’s 111
sovereignty in terms of Article 3 of the Constitution.

sovereignty.
v. Therefore, the Bill, as it seeks to repeal the provisions of law ගරු කථානායකතුමා

For the foregoing reasons, we are unable to accept the argument advanced by the learned
Counsel for the Petitioners that it was the intention of the Constitution to introduce ලිපි ලේඛනාදිය පිළිගැන්වීම

even thought nor had they wanted to confer any such benefit on any such person.
